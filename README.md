cpython-adventure
=================

This is a fork of Brandon Rhodes' awesome python adventure game.
As a young adult, this game was a favorite of mine. It inspired me to 
learn how computers and programming worked. Which "back in the day" was 
quite the adventure.

Come to think of it, contributing to CPython can be quite the adventure
too. If you choose to start your own adventure into CPython contribution,
you may need some helpful items along the way and be willing to bounce
back from a few brick walls.

Ready, set, begin...


Gratitude
---------
A special thanks and recognition to Brandon Rhodes' for the foundation
code for this game.


The game is based on 
Original Colossal Caves adventure game, but in Python 3
